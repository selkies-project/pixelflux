//! `zwlr_output_management_v1` client: scales and arranges the screens of a
//! nested session compositor, in-process rather than through a `wlr-randr` fork.
//!
//! Applications draw larger when the compositor they are on scales its own
//! output. Scaling pixelflux's capture output instead shrinks the logical size
//! the session is handed, which upscales the desktop rather than enlarging its
//! interface, so a DPI change for a nested session lands here.
//!
//! A session that opens one screen per capture output (a wlroots compositor
//! under `WLR_WL_OUTPUTS`) arranges them by its own rule — side by side in the
//! order they were opened — and that layout, not the capture one, is what
//! places its windows and carries its pointer between screens. So the capture
//! arrangement is mirrored into it (`set_screen_layout`), read back
//! (`list_screens`), and the screens no capture output drives yet are held at a
//! token size (`hold_spare_screens`) so the desktop does not lay out across a
//! screen nobody sees. Screens are addressed by position in name order
//! (WL-1, WL-2, ...), the order the session opened them in.
//!
//! Compositors without the protocol report [`ScaleOutcome::Unsupported`] and
//! position nothing here; their scale comes from the capture output, which
//! they follow, and a KWin session's arrangement lands through `kdeclient`
//! (`kde_output_management_v2`) instead. Blocking, off the compositor thread,
//! with every round-trip deadline-bounded.
