//! `org_kde_kwin_fake_input` client: relative pointer motion for a nested KWin
//! session.
//!
//! A nested compositor learns the pointer from pixelflux's seat. wlroots sessions
//! bind the seat's `zwp_relative_pointer_v1` and forward each delta to their
//! own relative-pointer clients, so a game under labwc turns with the mouse.
//! KWin's nested backend turns the host seat's motion into absolute-only events
//! and hands its relative-pointer clients — Xwayland's relative device included,
//! which SDL reads under a pointer grab — an empty delta; it binds the host's
//! relative pointer only behind its Right-Ctrl debug lock, which also freezes
//! absolute positioning. KWin has no `zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1` either. What it
//! offers is `org_kde_kwin_fake_input`, whose `pointer_motion` enters KWin's
//! delta path, so a relative move is delivered here as a client of the app
//! compositor, followed by the seat's own absolute move to the same position:
//! KWin sets its pointer from that rather than adding to it, which keeps the
//! two aligned — and realigns a KWin that moved its pointer by itself, as it
//! does when its screens change — while the composited cursor follows the seat
//! as always. Buttons and scrolling keep riding the seat. A compositor that
//! does not advertise the global keeps the seat path for deltas too.
//!
//! KWin restricts the global to trusted clients unless
//! `KWIN_WAYLAND_NO_PERMISSION_CHECKS` is set in its environment; a session that
//! withholds it simply never shows the global here. Authentication is requested
//! once after binding, as the protocol requires before any event is honoured.
//!
//! The connection is made on its own thread when selkies names the app
//! compositor ([`arm`]), and re-made on demand, rate-limited, after a failure,
//! so the compositor thread only ever performs a non-blocking write per delta.
