//! VA-API hardware sessions on a DRM render node for every video codec, driven through libva
//! directly.
//!
//! The session owns what a hardware encoder needs owned: the surfaces, the parameter buffers,
//! and, for the codecs that take them, the packed headers, so it also owns each picture's
//! reference lists. A frame a client lost is left out of the predictions the way NVENC and
//! libx264 allow (`encoders/reference.rs`): H.264 and HEVC keep the decoded picture buffer
//! the level admits and name the newest surviving frame in the slice header, VP9 and AV1
//! address their eight buffer slots, and VP8 steers its three buffers. A driver that writes its
//! own slice headers predicts from the previous frame alone, so such a session declares a
//! one-frame buffer.
//!
//! Pixels reach the codec on a VA surface -- a Wayland dmabuf imported in place, or a packed
//! host frame uploaded -- and the video processor converts to the surface format on the GPU,
//! so no colorspace conversion happens on the CPU. Chroma follows `video_fullcolor` where the
//! codec carries 4:4:4 (HEVC, and VP9 as profile 1), and the sample depth `video_bit_depth`
//! where the driver encodes the codec's 10-bit profile (HEVC Main 10 and Main 4:4:4 10, VP9
//! profiles 2 and 3, AV1), a session staying at 8 bits where it does not. A 4:4:4 session
//! tries the surface formats
//! the driver allocates and its video processor renders, read through a `VAProfileNone`
//! configuration, until one survives the surface pool, the convert, and the codec open. Every
//! session converts with the BT.709 matrix the sRGB source's own primaries and transfer belong
//! to, at limited range, and declares it; VP8 is held to BT.601, the only matrix its bitstream
//! can name. libva itself is loaded at run time, so the host's copy serves the driver it was
//! built for, and a test can put its own functions behind the same table.
