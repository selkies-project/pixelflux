//! Hardware H.264 through a generic stateful V4L2 M2M encoder.
//!
//! Boards that carry an encoder behind the kernel's own M2M interface publish no render node the
//! VA-API backend can probe and no vendor library the NVENC one can load, so the ladder reaches
//! software on hardware that encodes. A Raspberry Pi 4 is the case at hand (`bcm2835-codec`), and
//! RK356x and i.MX8M carry the same interface, so the node is discovered by what it offers rather
//! than by the board it sits on.
//!
//! One host frame becomes one access unit: the frame is copied into the output buffer, queued, and
//! the access unit comes back on the capture queue. The copy is the floor here as it is on Tegra —
//! X11 capture hands over host memory — and it costs 3.81 ms for a 1080p frame on a Pi 4, which is
//! the same speed as a copy between two ordinary allocations: the `videobuf2-dma-contig` buffer
//! takes a write stream at full memory bandwidth.
//!
//! Three things about such a device were measured rather than assumed, and each shapes the code:
//!
//! 1. The output queue takes packed 32-bit color and the firmware converts it, so nothing converts
//!    on the CPU. The fourcc names are the opposite way round from the memory a caller holds:
//!    `AB24` takes the BGRA an X11 capture produces, and `BGR4` takes RGBA. Decoding an encoded
//!    chart is what settled that; reading the names would have swapped red and blue.
//! 2. The conversion is BT.601 at full range, and it cannot be steered: a `S_FMT` asking for
//!    REC709 at limited range comes back echoed and changes nothing. The stream also carries no
//!    `video_signal_type`, so what the session declares has to be written into the SPS on the way
//!    out, which `collect` is the place for.
//! 3. Constant bitrate is not available, and asking for it does not merely fail: the driver hands
//!    the firmware a rate control mode it refuses, and the next `STREAMON` answers `ESRCH`. A
//!    control this session cannot set is therefore a refusal, never a warning — the node has to be
//!    closed and reopened to be usable again.
