//! CPU-based striped encoder: H.264 through the build's software encoder — libx264 with the
//! `gpl` feature, Cisco OpenH264 without it (`software_encoder`) — and turbojpeg for JPEG.
//!
//! Frames are split into horizontal stripes processed in parallel via rayon. Each stripe is
//! independently hashed against the previous frame for change detection, and only dirty stripes
//! are encoded. The H.264 path maintains per-stripe encoder state across frames for
//! inter-prediction, and both libraries emit the same per-stripe wire framing; the JPEG path is
//! stateless.

/// Convert a packed BGRA/RGBA buffer to planar YUV (4:2:0 or 4:4:4) for the software H.264
/// encoders, spreading the conversion across up to `bands` threads so it never bottlenecks a frame.
///
/// **Why the band split exists.** Color conversion is a non-trivial slice of per-frame CPU. The
/// striped path already parallelizes it for free — each stripe converts on its own rayon worker —
/// but a single full-frame consumer (the whole-frame x264 stripe, a full-frame OpenH264
/// instance, a whole-frame session of another codec) would otherwise convert its entire image on one thread and
/// stall the frame there. Splitting into horizontal bands hands that lone conversion the same
/// multi-threading the striped path enjoys. The cut is horizontal because YUV planes are
/// row-major, so a horizontal boundary yields contiguous, non-overlapping plane sub-slices with no
/// per-row seam bookkeeping.
///
/// 1. **Plane strides**: `strides` gives the Y and chroma row pitches of the output planes
///    (tightly packed for the stripe buffers, padded for an AVFrame); the chroma planes are
///    `width` wide for 4:4:4 (`i444 == true`) or `width / 2` for 4:2:0. `rgba_input` selects
///    the source byte order and `i444` the subsampling; `full_range` selects the signal range,
///    **Full** for the 4:4:4 stream x264 and x265 declare and **Limited** for everything else.
///    The matrix is **BT.709**, whose primaries and transfer the sRGB desktop source already
///    carries, unless `bt601` marks a codec whose bitstream can name no other matrix (VP8).
///    Every encoder declares the matrix it was fed. All four `yuv` crate routines run in the
///    **Fast** conversion mode.
/// 2. **Band split**: `band_h` is `height / bands` floored to an even number and at least 2 rows
///    (a band under 2 rows is not worth a task). Keeping band boundaries even ensures a 4:2:0
///    chroma pair never straddles a seam. When `bands <= 1` or the whole image fits one band, the
///    conversion runs on the calling thread in place.
/// 3. **Parallel bands**: otherwise `src` and the three output planes are carved into contiguous
///    per-band sub-slices (chroma rows scaled by `uv_rows` — full height for 4:4:4, half for
///    4:2:0) and converted on the rayon pool, whose workers already exist, so a frame spawns no
///    thread. The final band absorbs any leftover rows, taking all remaining rows whenever fewer
///    than `band_h + 2` are left. The first error wins.

    ///
    /// **Why this configuration.** These frames are captured live and must ship immediately, so the
    /// encoder is optimized for latency over compression ratio: the `ultrafast` preset keeps encode
    /// time under the frame budget, and `zerolatency` bars the frame reordering and lookahead
    /// buffering that would otherwise add pipeline delay. Everything below then bends x264 toward the
    /// pipeline's own keyframe and color model instead of its broadcast-oriented defaults.
    ///
    /// 1. **Preset/tune**: starts from the `ultrafast` preset with the `zerolatency` tune, then
    ///    overrides resolution, frame rate (floored to 30 fps when under 1), and thread count.
    /// 2. **Infinite GOP**: `i_keyint_max` is set to x264's infinite sentinel and adaptive scene-cut
    ///    is disabled (`i_scenecut_threshold = 0`), so the encoder never injects an unrequested IDR
    ///    on a scene change — keyframes are purely on-demand via the forced-IDR path, matching the
    ///    strict infinite-GOP model.
    /// 3. **Rate control**:
    ///    - **CBR** (`cbr_mode`): ABR targeting `bitrate_kbps` with a VBV cap pinned to the same
    ///      value (buffer `vbv_kbit`, precomputed by the caller from the frame-time multiplier
    ///      policy) and filler disabled. `max_qp` is the legibility floor (caps how ugly a
    ///      rate-starved frame gets) and `min_qp` the waste ceiling (stops over-spending on easy
    ///      content); both are clamped to 51, and the ceiling is 51 when unset because x264's
    ///      own default admits out-of-spec quantizers above it that exist only to force skips
    ///      when the VBV underflows, which leaves rows of the picture frozen on old content. A
    ///      budget the content cannot meet overshoots instead, as NVENC and libvpx do.
    ///    - **CRF** (default): constant-quality with `f_rf_constant = crf`. A positive
    ///      `vbv_kbit` caps it with a VBV of that buffer at a peak of `bitrate_kbps` (x264's
    ///      capped CRF): the rate factor still picks the quantizer and the VBV bounds the size
    ///      of a frame, a key frame above all, under CBR's ceiling of 51, so content the cap
    ///      starves overshoots it rather than freezes. `vbv_kbit == 0` leaves it uncapped.
    /// 4. **Color**: I444 at full range or I420 at limited range, a VUI declaring that range
    ///    with the BT.709 primaries, transfer, and matrix the sRGB source and the conversion
    ///    carry, and the matching `high444` / `baseline` profile.
    /// 5. **Coding tools**: CABAC and the 8x8 transform are disabled, matching the low-latency
    ///    baseline profile — CAVLC entropy coding with no 8x8 DCT — for minimal encode cost.
    /// 6. **Output**: repeated headers (SPS/PPS before each keyframe) and Annex-B framing, with
    ///    x264's own logging silenced.
    /// 7. **References**: a decoded picture buffer of `REFERENCE_FRAMES` (`i_dpb_size`), declaring
    ///    the lowest level up to 5.2 that holds them (`h264_reference_level`: 5.0 at 1080p, where
    ///    4.2 holds four), so `invalidate_reference` can leave a frame a client lost out of the
    ///    predictions with earlier frames still there to predict from, for a report up to eight
    ///    frames late (133 ms at 60 fps). Motion search keeps its single reference.
    /// 8. **`frame_num`**: x264 counts it in sixteen values for that buffer, and a loss covering
    ///    the frame where it wraps costs a key frame (`ReferenceWindow`), so the stream carries it
    ///    a byte wider (`WideFrameNum`): 4096 values, one such frame in 68 s at 60 fps.
    ///
    /// The `x264_encoder_open` call is serialized under `X264_OPEN_CLOSE_LOCK` because it mutates
    /// libx264 global state.

/// can be skipped on its own, and that only works if each stripe carries its *own* cross-frame
/// history. So one instance lives per stripe for the whole session and nothing per-stripe is rebuilt
/// or recomputed from scratch each frame:
/// - **Reused buffers**: `y_buf` / `u_buf` / `v_buf` hold the stripe's YUV planes and `packet_buf`
///   the encoded output, grown in place rather than reallocated per frame.
/// - **Encoder**: `h264_encoder` is the stripe's software H.264 instance — libx264 in a `gpl`
///   build, OpenH264 otherwise — reused until its geometry (or, for x264, chroma format) changes.
/// - **Cleanup / recovery**: `no_motion_frame_count` counts consecutive static frames,
///   `paint_over_sent` records that the region was cleaned up since it last changed,
///   `h264_burst_frames_remaining` tracks a post-cleanup or recovery streaming burst (held at the
///   paint-over quantizer where `burst_held`), and `dirty_run`, `change_mass`, `unclean_frames`,
///   and `motion` (the share of recent frames in motion) are what `pipeline::cleanup_due` weighs
///   to pick the cleanup's moment and kind; `clean_quality` keeps a constant-quality session at
///   the paint-over quality from a cleanup until the region changes again; `rc_bytes` (the bytes of
///   the stripe's last frame under its rate control), `idle_frames` (a constant-rate cleanup's run
///   of small frames short of the paint-over quality, of empty ones for x264), `same_frames` (of
///   frames the size of the one before), `finest` and `finest_frames` (the finest quality index
///   its rate control has coded at and the frames since), and `over_frames` (its run of frames over
///   `pipeline::OVERSHOOT_BUDGETS`) tell a cleanup that runs through the rate control when it has
///   converged, stalled, or been pinned at its coarsest quantizer, `fine_frames` counts its run of
///   frames at the paint-over quantizer or finer, `measured`, `measuring`, `level_checks`, and
///   `measure_in` are the last measurement of the picture it is refining, whether the frame before
///   was measured, the measurements in a row that found it level, and the frames to the next
///   (`pipeline::plateau`), `settled` records
///   that such a cleanup ran its course under a rate control it cannot hold a quantizer
///   under, so no other starts before the region moves, and `sweep` (the next band's start
///   and the last band's size, as shares of the picture) carries the band sweep a
///   full-frame refresh falls back to (`pipeline::decide_hw_fullframe`), `sweep_frames` its
///   bands so far and `sweep_coarser` the steps they are coded coarser than the refresh.
/// - **Content-hash damage** (only for sources without external damage, i.e. X11): `last_hash` is
///   the previous frame's content hash, `consecutive_changes` counts changed frames toward the
///   damage-block threshold, and `in_damage_block` / `damage_block_frames_remaining` drive the
///   sustained-motion damage block managed by `content_dirty`.

/// # Arguments
///
/// * `stripes` - Persistent per-stripe state vector (resized as needed, encoder state preserved).
/// * `raw_pixels` - Packed BGRA/RGBA pixel buffer (`width * height * 4` bytes).
/// * `width` - Frame width in pixels.
/// * `height` - Frame height in pixels.
/// * `damage_rects` - Wayland damage rectangles (empty for X11 hash-based detection).
/// * `settings` - Capture settings (quality, mode, rate control, etc.).
/// * `frame_counter` - Current frame number (wrapping `u16`).
/// * `use_gpu` - `true` when the source is RGBA (GLES readback); `false` for BGRA (X11 host).
/// * `hash_damage` - `true` for X11 stripe-hash change detection; `false` when damage rects
///   are provided.
/// * `force_idr_all` - Force a keyframe on every stripe (client join / reset / periodic IDR).
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Vec of [`EncodedStripe`] — empty when nothing changed.
/// repainting a stalled region at full quality, and letting a freshly-joined or reset client recover
/// a clean picture. Persistent `StripeState` is what makes both affordable: encoders and buffers
/// survive across frames instead of being rebuilt, and the motion/paint-over history the decision
/// needs lives right beside them. The per-stripe decision mirrors `decide_hw_fullframe`'s policy for
/// the hardware full-frame encoders; it is kept as separate code here because the striped path also
/// chooses JPEG-vs-H.264 and derives its own damage.
///
/// 1. **Stripe count**: the core count, held to `MAX_STRIPES` because the client decodes one
///    picture per stripe, but collapses to a single full-frame stripe when H.264 full-frame is
///    requested or the frame is shorter than the 64-row minimum, and no stripe is thinner than 64 rows —
///    below that the per-stripe encoder and thread overhead outweighs the parallelism and the tiny
///    H.264 slices compress poorly. The persistent `stripes` vector is resized to match, preserving
///    per-stripe state across frames.
/// 2. **Idle fast path**: a frame on which no stripe can emit anything (no damage / clean
///    hashes, no cleanup due, no burst, no recovery IDR, not streaming) only advances the
///    per-stripe cleanup bookkeeping inline and returns without dispatching the stripe
///    fan-out, so a static capture never wakes the rayon pool.
/// 3. **Dirty map**: with external compositor damage (`hash_damage == false`) each `damage_rects`
///    rectangle marks every stripe whose row range it overlaps. With `hash_damage == true` (X11,
///    which has no compositor damage) per-stripe content hashing drives dirtiness instead, in
///    streaming H.264 too, since the cleanup reads a still stripe from its content.
/// 4. **Per-stripe cleanup** (`pipeline::cleanup_due`, one region per stripe): a stripe that
///    changed is cleaned up once it has held still for `paint_over_trigger_frames`, or has kept
///    changing only a little for four times that, at the paint-over JPEG quality or, for H.264,
///    at the paint-over quality: under CBR through libx264's rate control, the stripe sent until it
///    codes at the paint-over quantizer or finer in a small frame (`pipeline::convergence`), or its
///    frames have been slice headers alone for `pipeline::EMPTY_S`, with no key frame, and where
///    the stripe's encoder reports no quantizer (OpenH264) as a refresh and burst at its rate
///    control's quality; under CRF as the stripe's rate factor until it changes again, as main's
///    paint-over was, as a key frame after a run of changes and a refresh otherwise, then a burst.
///    The stripes whose cleanups fall due on one
///    frame are spread over `CLEANUP_STAGGER_FRAMES` frames, so a screen going still costs no
///    one frame the whole screen's cleanup. A stripe is otherwise sent when it is dirty, while
///    its burst runs, or when streaming mode is on, at the base quality; a newly dirty frame
///    cancels its burst.
/// 5. **Recovery IDR** (`force_idr_all`): forces a send on every stripe even when static so a
///    reconnecting client can resume. For H.264 it forces an IDR at the stripe's own quality and
///    arms the burst (held at the paint-over quantizer at a constant quality, as in
///    `pipeline::decide_hw_fullframe`); for JPEG, where every stripe is already intra, it resends
///    a painted-over stripe at the paint-over quality already on screen so a joining viewer does
///    not see a downgrade.
/// 6. **Encoding**:
///    - **JPEG**: source byte order is RGBA on the GPU readback path and BGRA on
///      X11; each worker thread reuses its thread-local TurboJPEG compressor. Header-less output
///      hands the compressed buffer straight through; otherwise a 6-byte stripe header (`0x03` tag,
///      a reserved byte, frame number, y-start) is prepended to match the H.264 path's native
///      framing so the transport can forward the buffer without re-framing.
///    - **H.264**: the stripe's encoder is reused unless the width, height, or
///      (x264) chroma format changed, in which case it is rebuilt and an IDR forced; otherwise CRF
///      and rate are reconfigured live. With libx264, ARGB is converted to YUV here (a conversion
///      failure skips the stripe rather than encoding garbage) and an 8-byte fixed header (frame
///      number, y-start, width, height) is emitted; OpenH264 converts and frames inside
///      `encode_stripe_argb` with the same header layout, and encodes a 4:4:4 request 4:2:0 (said
///      once per process). The live CBR budget is recomputed here from the bitrate/fps so it
///      rescales with live changes.
/// 7. **Dispatch**: a single full-frame stripe runs inline (sequential — empirically faster than a
///    one-element rayon job) with one fewer encode thread than the available cores, clamped to
///    `[1, 4]` (x264 with a single-band color conversion; OpenH264 adds four slices and a four-band
///    conversion of its own). The slice threads keep the in-frame encode latency inside the frame
///    budget at high resolutions; the cap is four because `zerolatency` makes x264 slice-threaded
///    and more than four slices trips decode glitches in some Chromium builds, and the minus-one
///    leaves headroom for the capture thread. Multiple stripes instead run across the rayon pool
///    with a single encode thread and one conversion band each, since the parallelism there
///    already comes from encoding the stripes concurrently.
