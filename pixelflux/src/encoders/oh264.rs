//! Software H.264 encoder built on Cisco's OpenH264: the software H.264 encoder of a
//! build without the `gpl` feature, where it stands in for libx264 behind the same
//! striped software path (`encode_cpu`) — one instance per stripe, or one full-frame
//! instance when the session is full-frame — and emits the same wire framing, so a
//! client cannot tell which library a GPL-free build encodes with. Cisco's BSD license
//! is what lets it ship redistributably; the price of admission is being 4:2:0-only
//! (a 4:4:4 request is encoded 4:2:0) and Annex-B.
//!
//! Keyframes are driven externally — an effectively infinite intra period plus
//! on-demand `force_intra_frame`, never a fixed cadence — so a mostly-static screen
//! spends no bitrate on keyframes nothing requested, matching the NVENC/x264
//! strict-GOP streaming behavior. Host ARGB is converted to I420 with the same
//! BT.709 path the x264 encoder uses, then fed to OpenH264 as borrowed planes.

    ///    intact. Adaptive quantization and background detection are set explicitly to `false` to
    ///    silence the init warnings (both are auto-disabled for screen content anyway). Scene-change

    ///    correctly. The internal stderr trace follows the capture's `debug_logging` flag
    ///    (otherwise quiet).
    ///
    /// 4. **Rate control**:
    ///    - **CBR** (`video_cbr_mode`): bitrate-mode RC targeting `bitrate_kbps`, with the QP range
    ///      made explicit (`video_min_qp`, and `video_max_qp` defaulting the max to 51). The
    ///      explicit range dodges the same zero-substitution as the CRF floor, which would
    ///      otherwise cap the RC at QP 35 where hard content overshoots any target.
    ///    - **CRF/CQP** (default): the same bitrate-mode RC but with an oversized bitrate budget
    ///      (`BITRATE_CEILING_BPS`) and the QP pinned to a single value (`min == max == crf`), so
    ///      the QP clamp always dominates and every frame uses the constant QP — matching NVENC
    ///      CONSTQP / VAAPI CQP. Bitrate-mode with a pinned QP is what actually holds the QP
    ///      constant: RC_OFF ignores the QP range and RC_QUALITY rejects a `min == max` range.
