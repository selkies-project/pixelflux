//! Multi-GPU NVENC `GET_ATTACHED_IDS` / `GET_PROBED_IDS` ioctl filter — it exists so a container
//! handed only a subset of the host's GPUs can still open an NVENC session.
//!
//! The problem: on NVIDIA driver 570-595, `libnvidia-encode` / `libcuda` / `libnvcuvid` enumerate
//! every *host* GPU via the RM `GET_ATTACHED_IDS` ioctl and try to peer-init each one — including
//! GPUs the container never exposed. A GPU whose `/dev/nvidiaX` node is absent then makes
//! `nvEncOpenEncodeSessionEx` fail with UNSUPPORTED_DEVICE, so the session cannot open at all even
//! though a perfectly usable GPU is right there in the container.
//!
//! The fix is to strip the unreachable GPUs out of that enumeration response before the libraries
//! act on it. It GOT-patches `ioctl` in those NVIDIA libraries *only* — deliberately not an
//! LD_PRELOAD object, which would shadow every `ioctl` in the process and need its own recursion
//! guard. Because this crate's own GOT is left untouched, the wrapper's inner `ioctl` still resolves
//! to the real libc instead of re-entering itself.
//!
//! Everything hinges on at least one host GPU being hidden from the container, since that is the
//! only situation the bug arises in: on 565-or-before / 610-or-later drivers (enumeration already
//! correct) and whenever the container can see every host GPU, the strict-subset rule downstream
//! makes the whole filter a no-op.

// Walking the ELF tables and repointing GOT slots is raw-pointer work from
// end to end, so the safety contract is carried by the function signatures
// rather than by a block around each dereference.

///
/// 1. **Parse `.dynamic`**: iterate the `Elf64Dyn` entries until `DT_NULL`, recording the dynamic
///    symbol table, string table, PLT relocation table (`DT_JMPREL`/`DT_PLTRELSZ`) and general
///    relocation table (`DT_RELA`/`DT_RELASZ`). Table addresses are resolved through `dyn_addr` to
///    handle the glibc-absolute vs musl-relative pointer conventions.
/// 2. **Sanity-gate the tables**: bail if the symbol or string table is missing, and — via the
///    `readable` closure over `page_prot` — bail if a table's mapping is known but lacks read
///    permission (an address whose mapping cannot be determined is presumed readable), so a wrong
///    relative/absolute guess from `dyn_addr` cannot fault on first dereference. Also bail if the
///    page size is unavailable.
/// 3. **Patch both relocation tables**: hand each present, adequately-sized, readable table to
///    `patch_reloc_table`. The PLT table (`.rela.plt`) carries the classic lazily-bound `JUMP_SLOT`
///    entries; the general table (`.rela.dyn`) carries the `GLOB_DAT` slot that `-fno-plt` NVIDIA
///    builds use to bind `ioctl`.
