//! X11 backend for the Computer Use HTTP API: XTEST injection and one-shot root screenshots
//! over a private x11rb connection, so the agent can drive an X session with no active capture
//! and no shared state with any streaming capture thread (the X server itself serializes).
//!
//! Keysyms the active layout cannot produce (after base+AltGr resolution, which stays the
//! preferred path) are typed through a transient remap: under `XGrabServer` the keymap is
//! re-fetched, the needed keysyms are bound onto all-NoSymbol spare keycodes with ONE
//! `XChangeKeyboardMapping`, and the key sequence is injected; after a settle window (which
//! lets the focused client re-fetch the bound map — see `type_with_transient_binds`) one
//! conditional `XChangeKeyboardMapping` under a second grab puts the spares back — two
//! MappingNotify broadcasts per action. This coexists with a selkies session's own
//! spare-keycode overlay allocator on the same server: spares here are chosen DESCENDING
//! from the top of the keycode range while selkies allocates ASCENDING, each grab re-fetches
//! the keymap so every binding selkies already made is respected, the restore clears only
//! keycodes still carrying our content, and selkies' foreign-change invalidation (fired by
//! each MappingNotify) is self-healing because its held keys live on BOUND (non-NoSymbol)
//! keycodes an all-NoSymbol spare can never steal.
