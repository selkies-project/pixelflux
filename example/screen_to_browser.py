"""
A multi-client WebSocket and HTTP server for streaming screen captures.

This script demonstrates the pixelflux library's instance-safe capabilities.
It can handle multiple WebSocket clients, each with its own independent
screen capture session. The capture region can be controlled via the URL hash.

The capture callback never blocks and never buffers more than the
bounded per-client queue. When a client cannot drain the stream, the backlog
is dropped and H.264 delivery gates per stripe row until the next keyframe
(requested from the encoder at most once per second), so a slow consumer
costs bounded memory and resumes on a decodable frame.
