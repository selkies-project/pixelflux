# Regenerate the ARGB→NV12 convert's PTX from its CUDA source.
#
# The encoder ships PTX rather than a cubin so `libcuda`'s own JIT compiles it for whatever GPU
# is present, which is what keeps the NVENC path free of a runtime CUDA compiler. Two edits make
# the result as portable as the kernel itself: the ISA version and target are lowered to the
# oldest that carries these instructions, so every driver back to CUDA 5.5 and every
# NVENC-capable GPU accepts the module, and `__ldg`'s non-coherent load becomes a plain one,
# which is a cache hint rather than a semantic.
#
# nvcc rejects a host compiler newer than the one its release knew, so a second argument names
# the C++ compiler to hand it (`-ccbin`); the kernel has no host code, only nvcc's own headers
# need it.
